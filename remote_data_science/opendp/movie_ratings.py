# This file generates synthetic movie rating data
# using 3 different Differential Privacy Algorithms.
#
# The file preprocessed_10000_entires.csv in ./data
# contains approximately 10,000 entries from users
# that have rated movies on a 1 to 5 scale. The
# code below processes the data and feeds it into
# synthetic data generation algorithms using the
# OpenDP library.
#
# The code then calculates the average movie rating
# across each dataset, original and synthetic, and
# prints the results.
